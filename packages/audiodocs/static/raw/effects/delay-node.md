# DelayNode

The `DelayNode` interface represents the latency of the audio signal by given time. It is an [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node) that applies time shift to incoming signal f.e.
if `delayTime` value is 0.5, it means that audio will be played after 0.5 seconds.

#### [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#properties) properties

> **Info**
>
> Delay is a node with tail-time, which means, that it continues to output non-silent audio with zero input for the duration of `delayTime`.

## Constructor

[`BaseAudioContext.createDelay(maxDelayTime?: number)`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#createdelay)

## Properties

It inherits all properties from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#properties).

| Name | Type | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- |
| `delayTime`|  [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` representing value of time shift to apply. |

> **Warning**
>
> In web audio api specs `delayTime` is an `a-rate` param.

## Methods

`DelayNode` does not define any additional methods.
It inherits all methods from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#methods).

## Remarks

#### `maxDelayTime`

* Default value is 1.0.
* Nominal range is 0 - 180.

#### `delayTime`

* Default value is 0.
* Nominal range is 0 - `maxDelayTime`.
