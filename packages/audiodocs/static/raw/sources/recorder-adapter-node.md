# RecorderAdapterNode

The `RecorderAdapterNode` is an [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node) which is an adapter for [`AudioRecorder`](/docs/inputs/audio-recorder).
It lets you compose audio input from recorder into an audio graph.

## Constructor

```tsx
constructor(context: BaseAudioContext)
```

Or by using `BaseAudioContext` factory method:
[`BaseAudioContext.createRecorderAdapter()`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#createrecorderadapter)

## Example

```tsx
const recorder = new AudioRecorder({
    sampleRate: 48000,
    bufferLengthInSamples: 48000,
});
const audioContext = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 48000 });
const recorderAdapterNode = aCtxRef.current.createRecorderAdapter();

recorder.connect(recorderAdapterNode);
recorderAdapterNode.connect(audioContext.destination)
```

## Properties

`RecorderAdapterNode` does not define any additional properties.
It inherits all properties from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#properties).

## Methods

`RecorderAdapterNode` does not define any additional methods.
It inherits all methods from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#methods).

## Remarks

* Adapter without a connected recorder will produce silence.
* Adapter connected only to a recorder will function correctly and keep a small buffer of recorded data.
* Adapter will not be garbage collected as long as it remains connected to either a destination or a recorder.
