# Let's make some noise!

In this section, we will guide you through the basic concepts of Audio API. We are going to use core audio components such as [`AudioContext`](/docs/core/audio-context) and [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node) to simply play sound from a file, which will help you develop a basic understanding of the library.

## Using audio context

Let's start by bootstrapping a simple application with a play button and creating our first instance of `AudioContext` object.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
// highlight-next-line
import { AudioContext } from 'react-native-audio-api';

export default function App() {
  const handlePlay = async () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    const audioContext = new AudioContext();
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button onPress={handlePlay} title="Play sound!" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

`AudioContext` is an object that controls both the creation of the nodes and the execution of the audio processing or decoding.

## Loading an audio file

Before we can play anything, we need to gain access to some audio data. For the purpose of this guide, we will first download it from a remote source using.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { AudioContext } from 'react-native-audio-api';

export default function App() {
  const handlePlay = async () => {
    const audioContext = new AudioContext();
    // highlight-start
    const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);
    // highlight-end
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button onPress={handlePlay} title="Play sound!" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

We have used the [`decodeAudioData`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#decodeaudiodata) method of the [`BaseAudioContext`](/docs/core/base-audio-context), which takes a URL to a local file or bundled audio asset and decodes it into raw audio data that can be used within our system.

## Play the audio

The last and final step is to create an [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node), connect it to the `AudioContext's` destination, and start playing the sound. For the purpose of this guide, we will play the sound for just 10 seconds.

```jsx {10-11,13-15}
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { AudioContext } from 'react-native-audio-api';

export default function App() {
  const handlePlay = async () => {
    const audioContext = new AudioContext();
    const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);

    const playerNode = audioContext.createBufferSource();
    playerNode.buffer = audioBuffer;

    playerNode.connect(audioContext.destination);
    playerNode.start(audioContext.currentTime);
    playerNode.stop(audioContext.currentTime + 10);
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button onPress={handlePlay} title="Play sound!" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

And that's it! you have just played your first sound using react-native-audio-api. you can hear how it works in the live example below:

## Summary

In this guide, we have learned how to create a simple audio player using [`AudioContext`](/docs/core/audio-context) and [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node) as well as how we can load audio data from a remote source. To sum up:

* `AudioContext` is the main object that controls the audio graph.
* the [`decodeAudioData`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#decodeaudiodata) method can be used to load audio data from a remote resource in the form of an [`AudioBuffer`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer).
* `AudioBufferSourceNode` can be used with any `AudioBuffer`.
* In order to hear the sounds, we need to connect the source node to the destination node exposed by `AudioContext`.
* We can control the playback of the sound using [`start`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node#start) and [`stop`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node#stop) methods of the `AudioBufferSourceNode` (and other source nodes, which we will show later).

## What's next?

In [the next section](/docs/guides/making-a-piano-keyboard), we will learn more about how the audio graph works, what audio parameters are, and how we can use them to create a simple piano keyboard.
