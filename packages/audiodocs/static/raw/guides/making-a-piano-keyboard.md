# Making a piano keyboard

In this section, we will use some of the core Audio API interfaces to create a simple piano keyboard. We will learn what an [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) is and how to use it to change the pitch of the sound.

## Base application

Like in the previous example, we will start with a simple app with a couple of buttons so we don't need to worry about the UI later.
You can just copy and paste the code below to your project.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Pressable } from 'react-native';

type KeyName = 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E';

interface ButtonProps {
  keyName: KeyName;
  onPressIn: (key: KeyName) => void;
  onPressOut: (key: KeyName) => void;
}

const Button = ({ onPressIn, onPressOut, keyName }: ButtonProps) => (
  <Pressable
    onPressIn={() => onPressIn(keyName)}
    onPressOut={() => onPressOut(keyName)}
    style={({ pressed }) => ({
      margin: 4,
      padding: 12,
      borderRadius: 2,
      backgroundColor: pressed ? '#d2e6ff' : '#abcdef',
    })}
  >
    <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>{`${keyName}`}</Text>
  </Pressable>
);

export default function SimplePiano() {
  const onKeyPressIn = (which: KeyName) => {};
  const onKeyPressOut = (which: KeyName) => {};

  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        flexDirection: 'row',
      }}
    >
      {Keys.map((key) => (
        <Button
          onPressIn={onKeyPressIn}
          onPressOut={onKeyPressOut}
          keyName={key}
          key={key}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Create audio context and preload the data

Like previously, we will need to preload the audio files in order to be able to play them. Using the interfaces we already know, we will download them and store in the memory using the good old `useRef` hook.

First, we have the import section and the list of sources we will be using. Let’s also make things easier by using type shorthand for the partial record:

```tsx
import { AudioBuffer, AudioContext } from 'react-native-audio-api';

/* ... */

type PR<T> = Partial<Record<KeyName, T>>;

const sourceList: PR<string> = {
  A: 'https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-audio-api/audio/sounds/C4.mp3',
  C: 'https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-audio-api/audio/sounds/Ds4.mp3',
  E: 'https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-audio-api/audio/sounds/Fs4.mp3',
};
```

Then, we will want to fetch the audio files and store them. We want the audio data to be available to play as soon as possible, so we will use the `useEffect` hook to download them and store them in the `useRef` hook for simplicity.

```tsx
export default function SimplePiano() {
  const audioContextRef = useRef<AudioContext | null>(null);
  const bufferMapRef = useRef<PR<AudioBuffer>>({});

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!audioContextRef.current) {
      audioContextRef.current = new AudioContext();
    }

    Object.entries(sourceList).forEach(async ([key, url]) => {
      bufferListRef.current[key as KeyName] = await audioContextRef.current!.decodeAudioData(url);
    });
  }, []);
}
```

## Playing the sounds

Now it is finally time to play the sounds. We will use the [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node) and simply play the buffers.

```tsx
export default function SimplePiano() {
  const onKeyPressIn = (which: KeyName) => {
    const audioContext = audioContextRef.current;
    const buffer = bufferMapRef.current[which];

    if (!audioContext || !buffer) {
      return;
    }

    const source = new AudioBufferSourceNode(audioContext, {
      buffer,
    });

    source.connect(audioContext.destination);
    source.start();
  };
}
```

When we put everything together, we will get something like this:

Great! But there are a few things off here:

* We are not stopping the sound when the button is released, which is how a piano should work, right? 🙃
* You have probably noticed in the previous section, but we are missing sounds for keys 'B' and 'D'.

Let’s see how we can address these issues using the Audio API. We will go through them one by one. Ready?

## Key release

To stop the sound when keys are released, we will need to store somewhere source nodes, in order to be able to call [`stop`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node#stop) on them later. Just like with the audio context, let's use the `useRef` hook for this.

```tsx
const playingNotesRef = useRef<PR<AudioBufferSourceNode>>({});
```

Now we need to modify the `onKeyPressIn` function a bit

```tsx
const onKeyPressIn = (which: KeyName) => {
  const audioContext = audioContextRef.current!;
  const buffer = bufferMapRef.current[which];

  const source = new AudioBufferSourceNode(audioContext, {
    buffer,
  });

  source.connect(audioContext.destination);
  source.start();

  playingNotesRef.current[which] = source;
};
```

And finally, we can implement the `onKeyPressOut` function

```tsx
const onKeyPressOut = (which: KeyName) => {
  const source = playingNotesRef.current[which];

  if (source) {
    source.stop();
  }
};
```

Putting it all together again, we get:

And they stop on release, just as we wanted. But if we hold the keys for a short time, it sounds a bit strange. Also, have you noticed that the sound is simply cut off when we release the key? 🤔
It leaves a bit of an unpleasant feeling, right? So let’s try to make it a bit smoother.

## Envelopes ✉️

We will start from the end this time, and finally, we will use new type of audio node - [`GainNode`](/docs/effects/gain-node) :tada:&#x20;
`GainNode` is a simple node that can change the volume of any node (or nodes) connected to it. The `GainNode` has a single element called [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param), which is also named `gain`.

## What is an AudioParam?

An `AudioParam` is an interface that controls various aspects of most audio nodes, like volume (in the `GainNode` described above), pan or frequency. It allows us to control these aspects over time, enabling smooth transitions and complex audio effects.
For our use case, we are interested in two methods of an AudioParam:

* [`setValueAtTime`](/docs/core/audio-param/#setvalueattime)
* [`exponentialRampToValueAtTime`](/docs/core/audio-param/#exponentialramptovalueattime).

## What is an Envelope?

An envelope describes how a sound's amplitude changes over time. The most widely used model is **ADSR**, which stands for **Attack**, **Decay**, **Sustain**, and **Release**:

* **Attack** — time to ramp from silence to peak volume.
* **Decay** — time to fall from peak down to the sustain level.
* **Sustain** — volume level held while the note is active.
* **Release** — time to fade out after the note ends.

You can read more about envelopes and ADSR on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_\(music\)).

## Implementing the envelope

With all the knowledge we have gathered, let's get back to the code. In our `onKeyPressIn` function, besides creating the source node, we will create a [`GainNode`](/docs/effects/gain-node) which will stand in the middle between the source and destination nodes, acting as our envelope. &#x20;
We want to implement the **attack** in `onKeyPressIn` function, and **release** in `onKeyPressOut`. In order to be able to access the envelope in both functions we will have to store it somewhere, so let's modify the `playingNotesRef` introduced earlier. &#x20;
Also, let’s not forget about the issue with short key presses. We will address that by enforcing a minimal duration of the sound to one second (as it works nicely with the samples we have 😉).

Let’s start with the types:

```tsx
interface PlayingNote {
  source: AudioBufferSourceNode;
  envelope: GainNode;
  startedAt: number;
}
```

and the `useRef` hook:

```tsx
const playingNotesRef = useRef<PR<PlayingNote>>({});
```

Now we can modify the `onKeyPressIn` function:

```tsx
const onKeyPressIn = (which: KeyName) => {
  const audioContext = audioContextRef.current!;
  const buffer = bufferMapRef.current[which];
  const tNow = audioContext.currentTime;

  if (!audioContext || !buffer) {
    return;
  }

  const source = new AudioBufferSourceNode(audioContext, {
    buffer,
  });

  const envelope = audioContext.createGain();

  source.connect(envelope);
  envelope.connect(audioContext.destination);

  envelope.gain.setValueAtTime(0.001, tNow);
  envelope.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(1, tNow + 0.1);

  source.start(tNow);
  playingNotesRef.current[which] = { source, envelope, startedAt: tNow };
};
```

and the `onKeyPressOut` function:

```tsx
const onKeyPressOut = (which: KeyName) => {
  const audioContext = audioContextRef.current!;
  const playingNote = playingNotesRef.current[which];

  if (!playingNote || !audioContext) {
    return;
  }

  const { source, envelope, startedAt } = playingNote;

  const tStop = Math.max(audioContext.currentTime, startedAt + 5);

  envelope.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.0001, tStop + 0.08);
  envelope.gain.setValueAtTime(0, tStop + 0.09);
  source.stop(tStop + 0.1);

  playingNotesRef.current[which] = undefined;
};
```

As a result, we can hear something like this:

And it finally sounds smooth and nice. But what about decay and sustain phases? Both are handled by the audio samples themselves, so we do not need to worry about them. To be honest, same goes for the attack phase, but we have implemented it for the sake of this guide. 🙂&#x20;
So, the only piece left is addressing the missing sample files for the 'B' and 'D' keys. What can we do about that?

## Tampering with the playback rate

The [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node) also has its own [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param), called `playbackRate` as the title suggests. It allows us to change the speed of the playback of the audio buffer. &#x20;
Yay! Nice. But how can we use that to make the missing keys sound? I will keep this short, as this guide is already quite long, so let’s wrap up!

When we change the speed of a sound, it will also change its pitch (frequency). So, we can use that to make the missing keys sound.
Each piano key has its own dominant frequency (e.g., the frequency of the `A4` key is `440Hz`). We can check the frequency of each key, calculate the ratio between them, and use that ratio to adjust the playback rate of the buffers we have.

![Piano keys frequencies](/img/frequencies-on-piano.jpg)

For our example, let's use these frequencies as the base for our calculations:

```tsx
const noteToFrequency = {
  A: 261.626, // real piano middle C
  B: 277.193, // Db
  C: 311.127, // Eb
  D: 329.628, // E
  E: 369.994, // Gb
};
```

First, we need to find the closest key to the missing one. We can do this in simple for loop:

```tsx
function getClosest(key: KeyName) {
  let closestKey = 'A';
  let minDiff = noteToFrequency.A - noteToFrequency[key];

  for (const sourcedKey of Object.keys(sourceList)) {
    const diff = noteToFrequency[sourcedKey] - noteToFrequency[key];

    if (Math.abs(diff) < Math.abs(minDiff)) {
      minDiff = diff;
      closestKey = sourcedKey;
    }
  }

  return closestKey;
}
```

Now, we simply use the function in `onKeyPressIn` when the buffer is not found and adjust the playback rate for the source node accordingly:

```tsx
const onKeyPressIn = (which: KeyName) => {
  let buffer = bufferListRef.current[which];
  const aCtx = audioContextRef.current;
  let playbackRate = 1;

  if (!buffer) {
    const closestKey = getClosest(which);
    const closestBuffer = bufferMapRef.current[closestKey];
    playbackRate = noteToFrequency[closestKey] / noteToFrequency[which];
  }

  const source = aCtx.createBufferSource();
  const envelope = aCtx.createGain();
  source.buffer = buffer;
};
```

## Final effects

As before, you can see the final results in the live example below, along with the full source code.

## Summary

In this guide, we have learned how to create a simple piano keyboard with the help of the GainNode and AudioParams. To sum up:

* [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) is an interface that provides ways to control various aspects of audio nodes over time.
* [`GainNode`](/docs/effects/gain-node) is a simple node that can change the volume of any node connected to it.
* [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node) has a parameter called `playbackRate` that allows to change the speed of the audio buffer's playback, thereby altering the pitch of the sound.
* We can use `GainNode` to create envelopes, making the sound transitions smoother and more pleasant.
* We have learned how to use the Audio API in the React environment, simulating a more production-like scenario.

## What's next?

In [the next section](/docs/guides/noise-generation), we will learn how we can generate noise using the audio buffer source node.
