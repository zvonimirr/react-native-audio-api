# WorkletSourceNode

> **Warning**

> This node is dependent on `react-native-worklets` and you need to install them in order to use this node. Refer to [getting-started page](/docs/fundamentals/getting-started#possible-additional-dependencies) for more info.

The `WorkletSourceNode` interface represents a scheduled source node in the audio processing graph that generates audio using a worklet function. It extends [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node), providing the ability to start and stop audio generation at specific times.

This node allows you to generate audio procedurally using JavaScript worklets, making it perfect for creating custom synthesizers, audio generators, or real-time audio effects that produce sound rather than just process it.

For more information about worklets, see our [Introduction to worklets](/docs/worklets/worklets-introduction).

## Constructor

```tsx
constructor(
  context: BaseAudioContext,
  runtime: AudioWorkletRuntime,
  callback: (
    audioData: Array<Float32Array>,
    framesToProcess: number,
    currentTime: number,
    startOffset: number
  ) => void)
```

Or by using `BaseAudioContext` factory method:
[`BaseAudioContext.createWorkletSourceNode(worklet, workletRuntime)`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#createworkletsourcenode-)

## Example

```tsx
import { AudioContext } from 'react-native-audio-api';

function App() {
  const audioContext = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 44100 });

  // Create a simple sine wave generator worklet
  const sineWaveWorklet = (
    audioData: Array<Float32Array>,
    framesToProcess: number,
    currentTime: number,
    startOffset: number
  ) => {
    'worklet';

    const frequency = 440; // A4 note
    const sampleRate = 44100;

    // Generate audio for each channel
    for (let channel = 0; channel < audioData.length; channel++) {
      for (let i = 0; i < framesToProcess; i++) {
        // Calculate the absolute time for this sample
        const sampleTime = currentTime + (startOffset + i) / sampleRate;

        // Generate sine wave
        const phase = 2 * Math.PI * frequency * sampleTime;
        audioData[channel][i] = Math.sin(phase) * 0.5; // 50% volume
      }
    }
  };

  const workletSourceNode = audioContext.createWorkletSourceNode(
    sineWaveWorklet,
    'AudioRuntime'
  );

  // Connect to output and start playback
  workletSourceNode.connect(audioContext.destination);
  workletSourceNode.start(); // Start immediately

  // Stop after 2 seconds
  setTimeout(() => {
    workletSourceNode.stop();
  }, 2000);
}
```

## Worklet Parameters Explanation

The worklet function receives four parameters:

### `audioData: Array<Float32Array>`

A two-dimensional array where:

* First dimension represents the audio channel (0 = left, 1 = right for stereo)
* Second dimension contains the audio samples for that channel
* You must **write** audio data to these buffers to generate sound
* The length of each `Float32Array` equals `framesToProcess`

### `framesToProcess: number`

The number of audio samples to generate in this call. This determines how many samples you need to fill in each channel's buffer.

### `currentTime: number`

The current audio context time in seconds when this worklet call begins. This represents the absolute time since the audio context was created.

### `startOffset: number`

The sample offset within the current processing block where your generated audio should begin. This is particularly important for precise timing when the node starts or stops mid-block.

## Understanding `startOffset` and `currentTime`

The relationship between `currentTime` and `startOffset` is crucial for generating continuous audio:

```tsx
const worklet = (audioData, framesToProcess, currentTime, startOffset) => {
  'worklet';

  const sampleRate = 44100;

  for (let i = 0; i < framesToProcess; i++) {
    // Calculate the exact time for this sample
    const sampleTime = currentTime + (startOffset + i) / sampleRate;

    // Use sampleTime for phase calculations, LFOs, envelopes, etc.
    const phase = 2 * Math.PI * frequency * sampleTime;
    audioData[0][i] = Math.sin(phase);
  }
};
```

**Key points:**

* `currentTime` represents the audio context time at the start of the processing block
* `startOffset` tells you which sample within the block to start generating audio
* The absolute time for sample `i` is: `currentTime + (startOffset + i) / sampleRate`
* This ensures phase continuity and precise timing across processing blocks

## Properties

It has no own properties but inherits from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node).

## Methods

It has no own methods but inherits from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node):

## Performance Considerations

Since `WorkletSourceNode` generates audio in real-time, performance is critical:

* Keep worklet functions lightweight and efficient
* Avoid complex calculations that could cause audio dropouts
* Consider using lookup tables for expensive operations like trigonometric functions
* Test on target devices to ensure smooth audio generation
* Use `AudioRuntime` for better performance, `UIRuntime` for UI integration

## Use Cases

* **Custom Synthesizers**: Generate waveforms, apply modulation, create complex timbres
* **Audio Generators**: White noise, pink noise, test tones, sweeps
* **Procedural Audio**: Dynamic soundscapes, generative music
* **Real-time Effects**: Audio that responds to user input or external data
* **Educational Tools**: Demonstrate audio synthesis concepts interactively
