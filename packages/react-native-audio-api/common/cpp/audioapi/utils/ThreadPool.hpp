/// @brief A simple thread pool implementation using lock-free SPSC channels for task scheduling and execution.
/// @note The thread pool consists of a load balancer thread and multiple worker threads.
/// @note The load balancer receives tasks and distributes them to worker threads in a round-robin fashion.
/// @note Each worker thread has its own SPSC channel to receive tasks from the load balancer.
/// @note The thread pool can be shut down gracefully by sending a stop event to the load balancer, which then propagates the stop event to all worker threads.
/// @note IMPORTANT: ThreadPool is not thread-safe and events should be scheduled from a single thread only.
/// @tparam TaskSize Maximum size in bytes of a scheduled task closure (stored
/// inline via stdext::inplace_function, no heap allocation). Tasks larger than
/// this fail at compile time. Pick the smallest value that fits all your
/// schedule(...) call sites; smaller is better as it shrinks the SPSC slot
/// footprint and keeps the audio-thread allocation contract enforced.
